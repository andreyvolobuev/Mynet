Educational purpose library that will help you understand how neural networks really work üß†

It is and always will be 100% dependency free, pure Python from scratch. All major components of a neural network (loss functions, activation functions, optimizers) are already implemented *or will be implemented soon* ‚ò∫Ô∏è If you see a component that you would like to add - just send a PR, they are always welcome üôèüèª

Absolutely not suitable for production as it's slow as hell and definitely won't be able to run a model playing StarCraft realtime. Instead it can run a relatively simple model and show you what is going on under the hood of ANY major deep learning framework as all of them are basically doing the same thing. That is the point.
